# Vehicle license plate

## Summary

Vehicle license plates are the front and rear plates fixed to a vehicle. A plate has 7 letters and digits.

## Validation rules

### Mercosul standard
1. The plate has 7 letters and digits in the `LLLNLNN` pattern.

### Pre-Mercosul standard
1. The plate has 7 letters and digits in the `LLLNNNN` pattern, in two groups:
   - The first group is 3 letters (`A` to `Z`).
   - The second group is 4 digits.

## Algorithm

1. Remove the whitespace at the start and at the end, and the mask characters (whitespace, `.`, `-` or `/`, alone or in a run) between the third character and the last four. A mask character anywhere else, or any other character, makes the plate invalid.
2. Check that 7 characters remain.
3. Check that all characters are alphanumeric.
4. Check that the input follows one of the valid patterns:
   - Mercosul: `LLLNLNN`
   - Pre-Mercosul: `LLLNNNN`
5. If the input follows neither pattern, the license plate is invalid.

## Regex

- Raw input (the mask sits between the third character and the last four): `^[A-Za-z]{3}[\s.\-/]*[0-9A-Za-z]{4}$`
- Characters only (pre-Mercosul or Mercosul pattern): `^(?:[A-Z]{3}[0-9]{4}|[A-Z]{3}[0-9][A-Z][0-9]{2})$`

## Examples

- Valid: `ABC1234` (pre-Mercosul standard)
- Valid: `ABC1D23` (Mercosul standard)
- Invalid: `AB12345` (does not follow any valid format)
- Invalid: `ABCD123` (incorrect number of letters)
- Invalid: `ABC123` (fewer than 7 characters)
- Invalid: `ABC12D4` (incorrect character order)
